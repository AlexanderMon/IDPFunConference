			<h2>IDPfun</h2>
			<h4>A H2020 funded Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Research and Innovation Staff Exchange projec </h4>
			<p>IDPfun is an international consortium aiming to extend our knowledge on the functions of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Starting from available state of the art computational tools and databases, which have been mostly developed by IDPfun participants, it aims to drive a new level of IDP characterization.</p>
			<p>Overall objective of IDPfun research is to address major current and future challenges in IDP field: to improve our understanding of IDP biological functions and translate this knowledge into major international databases for wider scientific community benefit. During the project lifetime we will solve a set of major problems in protein science and bioinformatics that are highly innovative:</p>
			<p>IDPfun project consists of five interlinked work packages, arranged in order to cover the ground from the current state of the art of IDP detection and classification, towards the definition of functional mechanisms and their translation towards wider scientific community by deploying gathered knowledge in public international databases, such as UniProt.</p>
